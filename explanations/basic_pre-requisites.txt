DNA string : long sequence of ATGC/ nucleotides (what the model processes)
  - Prokaryotes: simple organisms like bacteria. Typically has a single circular chromosome.
  - Eukaryote: complex organisms like humans or yeast. Humans have 46 chromosomes.
By DNA string is meant the physical DNA molecule

- Chromosomes: DNA is really long, so it is split into 46 parts, that are organized in chromosomes. Most cells contain all 46 chromosomes.

- Genome: all genetic material in an organism. So all 46 chromosomes for humans. All information for an organism to function and reproduce.

- Nucleotide: basic building block of DNA strands. Can be A, C, G or T.

- Base pairs: DNA is double stranded, and the strands are held together by nucleotides pairing up. A pairs to T, and G pairs to C.

The reason the model works with single ACGT strings instead of pairs, is that they are always complementary anyways. A always pairs to T, G always pairs to C.
