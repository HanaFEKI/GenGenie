## Evo2: Genome modeling and design across all domains of life
This is a large language model just like ChatGPT, but instead of taking text as input, it takes the ATGC sequence and predict the next sequence that fits with the given one.

So the training dataset here would be the genomes for all the domains of life (from the simple bacteria to the complex human genome). So here instead of predicting the next word in a paragraph, we are predicting the next sequence in a DNA sequence.
